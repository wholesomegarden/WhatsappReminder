Hello everyone,
We start ..... I wish you all good luck 🌻 and that you will get the most out of this magical process.
*Lesson 1 - "Good begets Good" - On Spiritual Wealth and Human Wealth*
Today's task according to 1-3 levels of commitment – choose at least one of them, no matter what, the main thing is that you will feel comfortable and feel committed and connected to the process.
Day 1 Tasks:

1. *Watch the TED talk* - Poverty isn't a lack of character; it's a lack of cash | Rutger Bregman & reflect on what you saw.
https://youtu.be/ydKcaIE6O1k

2. *I have it - I have it* - a list of 18 things you already have in life.

3. *48 people* who have added value to your life - In the notebook you have chosen for the process, create a list of people who have added value to your life.
Write down everyone who is positive and who in your perception made you grow in some way.
The list must be complete according to the level of commitment you have chosen. It is important to remember that even people who seemingly did you "bad" made you grow. (While doing this, you will understand with yourself what the reason is for choosing them on the list). Proceed calmly, remembering the good things in each person, and what he / she has brought into your life.
Enjoy this activity!

		*Welcome to the first day of the 18 days of Sustainability & Leadership challenge - NO POVERTY.*
Did you know that almost half of the world's population lives in poverty worldwide – and that there are over a billion people - who still live on $ 1.25 a day or less, and the number has risen since the corona.
Should we blame those poor children who are born into such a reality?
& how those children will grow up knowing they will never be able to escape their poverty?
*What does this mean at all? What does this tell about our future? And what can be done?*
According to the SDG’s, the Sustainable Development Goals set by the UN member states, goal number 1 is to reduce by half by 2030, the relative percentage of the poor in the world. And in your country? What goal did you commit to? What goal did we commit to? What employment opportunities are available to those of us living in poverty? What services and products exist for those of us living in poverty?
Since the outbreak of the corona plague, the economic situation of many citizens around the world has been so difficult that they are sometimes forced to give up one of the most basic human needs - food.
Eliminating poverty is not a task of charity, but an act of justice.
*What can you do now to fight poverty?*
*And now for spiritual wealth.*
We have compiled a list of people who have added value to our lives and focused on what we have in life. *What is spiritual wealth and what does it have to do with real wealth?* We can understand this when we think of our family, a family that supports each other when needed. When your brother or sister achieves success, the whole family celebrates. At the deepest spiritual level, we are connected not only to our parents and siblings but to the whole world, as we grow in this awareness, we live in oneness, celebrating the success of all. The human family.
Spend some time practicing unity, be present and be frequently interested in the lives of others when you talk to them. In your conversations, give your full attention and if you see someone in need, offer help.
Sharpening your observation of your surroundings and doing these things will help you develop a deeper understanding of true relationships.
The main thought for today:
*"Who is a rich man? He who is happy with his share".*

Task for the second day - ZERO HUNGER 💖 🌏 💖
Choose one of three tasks, no matter which one, the main thing is that you feel comfortable, committed and connected to the process. Challenge yourself to eat differently.
1. Watch the TED talk - What we're getting wrong in the fight to end hunger | Jasmine Crowe |& reflect on what you saw. Then, enter the telephone list of the group members and send to another group member of your thoughts from the video and in general in the context of poverty and hunger in your city/country and things to be done.
https://youtu.be/VasJyDmMafA

2. Avoid sweets - Choose not to eat sweets (Cakes, candies, soft drinks etc.) - from today until the end of the challenge, (at the end of the practice, mark the day number and 🍒 2 every day from now until the end of the challenge).

3. VegaNation Challenge yourself to eat vegan or vegetarian from today until the end of the challenge (at the end of the practice, mark the day number and 🌏 2 each day from now until the end of the challenge).
The main thing is that you maintain a better diet than you are used to. What do you say, can you?
After successfully completing the task until tomorrow at 20:00, type 🌏 or 🍒 2 in the group and each day from now until the end of the challenge.

		*Welcome to the second day of the challenge - ZERO HUNGER*
We want more, consume more and throw away more, and not just food. What does this tell about us at all?
If we promote sustainable agriculture with modern technologies and fair distribution systems, we will be able to sustain the entire population of the world and make sure that no one will ever suffer from hunger.
According to the SDG’s, goal number 2 is - by 2030, to end hunger and ensure access for all human beings - especially the poor, children and people in vulnerable situations - to safe, nutritious and satisfying food throughout the world.
What is being done to stop the huge waste of food and make sure it reaches those who need it? Our planet has provided us with tremendous resources, but unequal access and ineffective care leave millions of people suffering from malnutrition.
*What can you change now in your food consumption habits? *
*One small change for you in your food consumption habits, one giant change for humanity.*
It is important to know that it is possible otherwise, that we can imagine and act for a better future - for a spiritual abundance that will replace the material and the extra waste.
The main thought for today: *"Who is a rich man? He who shares".*

"Health is a basic human right" (International Health Organization), and a key indicator of sustainable development.
Women all over the world still lack access to medical care related to sex and fertility; Billions of people are left without access to essential medicines, millions of adults and children will suffer from malnutrition this year, and some estimate that the amount of waste will triple this year. This will have serious health effects. In addition, thousands of new cases of the corona plague continue to happen every day, leading to political and economic instability, threatening the livelihoods of many of the world’s inhabitants. True, the Corona vaccine has not yet been found, development is under way, but think - who do you think will be the first to benefit from it?
What can you do now to become healthier, body, mind and spirit?
The main thought for today: a healthy mind in a healthy body in a healthy world

		Welcome to the third day of the challenge - GOOD HEALTH & WELL BEING
"Health is a basic human right" (International Health Organization), and a key indicator of sustainable development.
Women all over the world still lack access to medical care related to sex and fertility; Billions of people are left without access to essential medicines, millions of adults and children will suffer from malnutrition this year, and some estimate that the amount of waste will triple this year. This will have serious health effects. In addition, thousands of new cases of the corona plague continue to happen every day, leading to political and economic instability, threatening the livelihoods of many of the world’s inhabitants. True, the Corona vaccine has not yet been found, development is under way, but think - who do you think will be the first to benefit from it?
What can you do now to become healthier, body, mind and spirit?
The main thought for today: a healthy mind in a healthy body in a healthy world
