Hello everyone,
We start ..... I wish you all good luck and that you will get the most out of this magical
process.
*Lesson 1 - "Good begets Good" - On Spiritual Wealth and Human Wealth*
Today's task according to 1-3 levels of commitment – choose at least one of them, no matter what, the main thing is that you will feel comfortable and feel committed and connected to the process.
Day 1 Tasks:
1. *Watch the TED talk* - Poverty isn't a lack of character; it's a lack of cash | Rutger Bregman & reflect on what you saw.
https://youtu.be/ydKcaIE6O1k
2. *I have it - I have it* - a list of 18 things you already have in life.
3. *48 people* who have added value to your life - In the notebook you have chosen for the process, create a list of people who have added value to your life. Write down everyone who is positive and who in your perception made you grow in some way.

The list must be complete according to the level of commitment you have chosen. It is important to remember that even people who seemingly did you "bad" made you grow. (While doing this, you will understand with yourself what the reason is for choosing them on the list). Proceed calmly, remembering the good things in each person, and what he / she has brought into your life.
Enjoy this activity!
